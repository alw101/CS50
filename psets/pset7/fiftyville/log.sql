--RUTH: Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the courthouse parking lot and drive away.
--      If you have security footage from the courthouse parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.
--Eugene: I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at the courthouse, 
--        I was walking by the ATM on Fifer Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.
--Raymond: As the thief was leaving the courthouse, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. 
--      In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. 
--      The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
